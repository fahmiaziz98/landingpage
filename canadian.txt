CANADA IMMIGRATION AND JOB APPLICATION GUIDE

=== WORK PERMITS ===

What is a work permit?
A work permit is a legal document that allows foreign nationals to work in Canada temporarily. Most foreign workers need a work permit to work in Canada legally.

Types of work permits:
1. Employer-specific work permit - You can only work for a specific employer, at a specific location, for a specific period.
2. Open work permit - You can work for any employer in Canada (with some exceptions).

How long does it take to get a work permit?
Processing times vary by country and application type. Generally, it takes 2-8 weeks for online applications and 8-16 weeks for paper applications.

Do I need a job offer to get a work permit?
For employer-specific work permits, yes. For open work permits, usually no, but you must meet specific eligibility criteria.

=== EXPRESS ENTRY ===

What is Express Entry?
Express Entry is Canada's main immigration pathway for skilled workers. It manages applications for three federal economic immigration programs:
- Federal Skilled Worker Program
- Federal Skilled Trades Program

How does Express Entry work?
You create an online profile and are ranked using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). The highest-ranking candidates receive Invitations to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence.

What is the CRS score?
The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) is a points-based system used to assess and rank your profile. Maximum score is 1200 points.

CRS factors include:

- Language skills (maximum 160 points)
- Work experience (maximum 80 points)
- Additional factors like Canadian work experience, job offer, provincial nomination

What is a good CRS score?
CRS cutoff scores vary with each draw. Recent draws typically require scores between 480-510 points. Higher scores increase your chances.

How can I improve my CRS score?
- Improve language test scores (IELTS, CELPIP, TEF)
